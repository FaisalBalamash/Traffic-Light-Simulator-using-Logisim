## Overview
The CIRC document represents a Traffic Light Simulator circuit created in Logisim. It emulates the behavior of traffic lights at an intersection and includes various components, connections, and logic to control the lights' operation.

## Document Structure
The XML document follows a structured format, including elements such as `<project>`, `<circuit>`, `<comp>`, and `<wire>`. These elements define the circuit's components and connections, allowing for the simulation of traffic lights.

## Components
The circuit comprises several components, including:
- Traffic Light Lamps: Representing the red, yellow, and green lights for each direction.
- Control Logic: Such as AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates for managing light sequences.
- Input Pins: To control and configure the simulation.

Each component has specific attributes and connections to facilitate the simulation.

## Connections
Connections between components are defined using `<wire>` elements. These connections ensure that the traffic light lamps change according to the control logic and input signals.

## Simulation Details
The Traffic Light Simulator provides a detailed simulation of traffic light behavior, including:
- Sequential light changes at intersections.
- Logic for pedestrian crossing signals.
- Handling of input signals for different traffic scenarios.

## Usage
To use the Traffic Light Simulator in Logisim, follow these steps:
1. Open Logisim and load the CIRC document containing the circuit.
2. Configure the input pins to control traffic scenarios or pedestrian crossings.
3. Simulate the circuit to observe the traffic light behavior.

For specific details on configuring and simulating the circuit, refer to Logisim's documentation.

This README provides an overview of the Traffic Light Simulator circuit implemented in Logisim. For detailed information about the circuit's components, connections, and logic, please refer to the CIRC document itself.
